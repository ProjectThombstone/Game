Unnamed Game
====

This is a game.

All the information on the game, and about the game will be posted right here on the Git Hub!


Basics
====

Our game is built using [UNITY](www.unity3d.com)! This super powerful advanced engine allows us to use tools such as Blender to create 3D models that we can then move around using a native Javascript or C# library.

This powerful engine is also free, so it makes developing a lot better on our side of things - we don't have to fork money out!
